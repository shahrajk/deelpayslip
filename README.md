# Getting Started with Create React App and Capacitor

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and enhanced with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) to support native functionality on iOS and Android.

## Running the Project

To run this project on different platforms, follow the steps below after cloning the repository from GitHub:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Capacitor CLI installed globally (`npm install -g @capacitor/cli`)
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development)

### Clone the Repository

- git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
- cd your-repo-name

```bash
npm install
```

### Run on Web

```bash
npm start
```

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Run on Android

1. Add the Android platform:

   ```bash
   npx cap add android
   ```

2. Sync the project:

   ```bash
   npx cap sync
   ```

3. Open the project in Android Studio:

   ```bash
    npx cap open android
   ```

4. Build and run the project from Android Studio.

### Run on iOS

1. Add the iOS platform:

   ```bash
   npx cap add ios
   ```

2. Sync the project:

   ```bash
   npx cap sync
   ```

3. Open the project in Xcode:

   ```bash
    npx cap open ios
   ```

4. Build and run the project from Xcode.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Capacitor

This project integrates Capacitor to enable cross-platform functionality. For more information on Capacitor, visit the [official documentation](https://capacitorjs.com/docs).

### `npx cap sync`

Synchronizes your web app with native projects.

### `npx cap open ios`

Opens the iOS project in Xcode for building and running on an iOS device or simulator.

### `npx cap open android`

Opens the Android project in Android Studio for building and running on an Android device or emulator.

### `npx cap serve`

Starts a live-reload server on your local network and opens it in the default browser.

## Download Functionality

This project includes functionality to download and open payslip files across different platforms (web, iOS, Android).

### Web

On the web, the payslip files can be downloaded directly using a Blob and an anchor tag.

### iOS and Android

On mobile platforms, the payslip files are fetched and written to the device's filesystem using Capacitor's Filesystem API. Files can then be opened using the appropriate native application.

  - **utils/**: Contains utility functions and mock data.
    - **mockData.ts**: Provides sample payslip data for development purposes.
  - **pages/**: Contains page-level components.
    - **PayslipDetails.tsx**: Displays and handles the download of a specific payslip.
    - **PayslipList.tsx**: Displays a list of all available payslips.
  - **App.tsx**: The main application component that sets up routing and application structure.
  - **index.tsx**: The entry point for the React application.
- **android/**: Contains the Android project files generated by Capacitor.
- **ios/**: Contains the iOS project files generated by Capacitor.
